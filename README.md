# Love Em or Hate Em

Basically the same as the pairing project today:

- import the api.js file and save it to state
- a click on the '+' will render the artist to the 'I'm a fan of...' div
- a click on the '-' will render the artist to the 'I'm not a fan of...' div

- the artist can't be rendered to both divs at the bottom - you can't love them and hate them.


** I included some css styling within the components **
